# What is this place?

- This place serves as a code repository for the entire website - both Front End & Back End part.
- We did this because transparency is a thing that exists, and to prove that we do not have the intentions to promote shady things.
  - *coughs* MSOC+ *coughs*.
- Perhaps to *show off* our programming skill and let the team has something to put on their CV? 

# Can you explain the directory structure?

- `MSOC`: the user facing portion.
- `MSOC.Backend`: the backside of the web, containing *most* of the useful APIs.
- `MSOC.Backend.Tests`: containing the Unit and Integration tests for the backend. Since the APIs in the backend make heavy uses of the database, we try our best to test the entire backend in transactional manner, and to cover many edge cases as possible. 
  - [We leverage GitHub Action to test on every commit](https://github.com/team-nameless/msoc-web/blob/main/.github/workflows/backend.yml). The result can be seen here: [![Sanity check](https://github.com/team-nameless/msoc-web/actions/workflows/backend.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/team-nameless/msoc-web/actions/workflows/backend.yml)

# How can I run the code?

- If you ask this question, I doubt you are a developer.

# Can I help?

- Sure, send a message to `@hidr0` on Discord.
