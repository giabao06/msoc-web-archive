# What's this?

*yes.*

OK, let's be real, we founded a studio dedicated for event organization. And in that case, we need a website to serve for:

- Our branding.
- Tournament information (participating players, qualifier standings and posting updates)
- Serving for the tournament (game updates, ban/pick-ing throughout the course of the game, final standings)

## What's more?

idk, we still cooking.
